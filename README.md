# Bloc Box
Blocbox was the very first UI/UX web design project in Bloc's program. Blocbox is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application concept which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others. 

The main focus of this project was to understand the concepts behind User Experience and User Interface design which includes typography, color theory, and rapid prototyping. In addition, I learned about the basics of HTML, cascading stylesheets, and media queries.
